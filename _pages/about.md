I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at the Pennsylvania State University. I am currently working with Dr. Murali Haran (Penn State) and Dr. John Hughes (Lehigh).

I received my M.A. in Applied statistics from Yonsei University in South Korea in 2018 and worked with Dr. Taeyoung Park. I received my B.A. in Business administration and Applied statistics from the same in 2016.

My research is in the areas of statistical computing, Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, models for spatial and spatiotemporal data, and infectious disease modeling.
