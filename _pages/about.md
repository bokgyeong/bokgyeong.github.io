I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at Pennsylvania State University. I am currently working with Dr. Murali Haran.

I received my M.A. in Applied statistics from Yonsei University in South Korea in 2018, and my B.A. in Business administration and Applied statistics from the same in 2016. During my Masterâ€™s program, I worked as a research assistant under the supervision of Dr. Taeyoung Park.

My research is in the areas of statistical computing, Bayesian methods, and spatiotemporal models.
