I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at the Pennsylvania State University. I am currently working with Dr. Murali Haran.

I received my M.A. in Applied statistics from Yonsei University in South Korea in 2018 and worked with Dr. Taeyoung Park. I received my B.A. in Business administration and Applied statistics from the same in 2016.

My research is in the areas of statistical computing, Bayesian methods, and spatial models. She is mainly interested in exploring diagnostic methods for assessing asymptotically approximate algorithms for Bayesian inference.
