I am a postdoctoral researcher in Statistical Science at Duke University. I am working with Dr. Alan Gelfand (Statistical Science at Duke), Dr. Robert Schick (Nicholas School of the Environment at Duke), and Dr. Erin Schliep (Statistics at NC State). 

I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from the Pennsylvania State University in 2023 and worked with Dr. Murali Haran (Penn State) and Dr. John Hughes (Lehigh). I received my M.A. in Applied statistics from Yonsei University in South Korea in 2018 and worked with Dr. Taeyoung Park. I received my B.A. in Business Administration and Applied Statistics from Yonsei University in 2016.

I have research interests in statistical computing, primarily Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, and spatial statistics. My work is motivated by problems in infectious disease research, environmental science, and ecology.
